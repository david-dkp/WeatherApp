<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](screenshots/desktop-screenshot.png)

-   Where can I see your demo?
    You can see my demo right here :D : https://unruffled-fermi-18e89f.netlify.app/
-   What was your experience?
    I've already done some Web projects, but not as big as this one. They were mainly "small" projects, each were focusing on a specific feature.
-   What have you learned/improved?
    I learned to build a website with React from A to Z, which is completly responsive and overall good looking.
    I learned how to share states between different components with Redux.
    I learned how to do API calls while handling loading state.
    I learned that I could build something great by just trusting myself a little bit :D
-   Your wisdom? :)
